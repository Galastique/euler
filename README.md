# Euler
These are my take on the Euler Project's problems!

I initially started solving the Euler Project's problems to learn to code in python,
but as time went by I realized that I could also use it to improve my skills in other languages as well.
So here are my takes on them! They are not the best, they are not all well optimized, 
but they are mine, which is all that matters to me. 
This can also act as some sort of archive of the evolution of my programming skills over the following years.

Feels free to inspire yourself from these to solve the problems yourself!
Do not copy though, otherwise it ruins the fun of solving them by yourself :)
